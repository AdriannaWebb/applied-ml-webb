# Project 2: Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis and machine learning preparation on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze passenger data and prepare features for predicting survival outcomes.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is loaded directly from the seaborn library and contains information about passengers including demographics, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Project Structure
- **ml02_yourname.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- **README.md**: Project documentation

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Import and Inspection
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset
- Identify missing values and data types
- Calculate summary statistics and correlations

### 2. Data Exploration and Preparation
- Visualize data patterns using scatter plots, histograms, and count plots
- Handle missing values through imputation and cleaning
- Engineer new features like family size

### 3. Feature Selection
- Select relevant input features for prediction
- Define target variable (survival status)
- Justify feature choices based on exploratory analysis

### 4. Data Splitting
- Compare basic train/test split with stratified splitting
- Evaluate class distribution across splits
- Assess which method produces better balance

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Requirements
All dependencies from Project 1 are reused for this analysis.
